# Global-Sustainable-Energy Insights (2000-2020)
This project analyzes global sustainable energy data from 2000 to 2020 to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships in renewable electricity generation, capacity, and environmental impact. Through comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, the project reveals how renewable energy has grown worldwide, compares top-performing countries, examines correlations between economic indicators like GDP per capita and renewable capacity, and assesses the impact on CO2 emissions. The project also includes forecasting to predict future renewable energy generation for selected countries. Visualizations such as time-series plots, bar charts, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps provide clear insights into the global energy transition, helping inform policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders about progress and challenges in moving toward a sustainable energy future.

The dashboard was built using following tools and technologies:

Programming Language
* Python 3 — Primary language for data processing and analysis

Data Analysis & Manipulation
* pandas — Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
* numpy — Numerical operations and calculations

Visualization
* matplotlib — Plotting various types of charts and graphs
* seaborn — Advanced and aesthetic statistical data visualization

Time Series & Forecasting
* statsmodels (Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing) — Time series forecasting and modeling

Interactive Analysis & Notebook Environment
* Jupyter Notebook — Interactive code, narrative, and visualization platform

The dataset “Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)” provides comprehensive information on renewable energy production, capacity, and related economic and environmental indicators across multiple countries worldwide. It covers a 21-year period, including metrics such as renewable electricity generation in terawatt-hours, CO2 emissions, GDP per capita, and energy access statistics. The data enable analysis of trends in sustainable energy adoption, economic correlations, and environmental impact. With geographical and temporal dimensions, this dataset is ideal for studying global progress in clean energy and informing policy decisions.

Features 

The business problem addressed by this project is understanding and quantifying global progress in adopting sustainable energy, and identifying the key drivers and barriers that affect different countries' transitions to renewable power sources. Organizations, policymakers, and investors need to know which regions are leading or lagging, what economic or environmental factors are influencing adoption, and how renewable energy expansion impacts carbon emissions and long-term sustainability goals. Insights from this analysis help guide investment decisions, shape strategic energy policies, and monitor the effectiveness of clean energy initiatives to achieve global environmental and economic targets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:

- Trends Over Time: Visualized the global increase in renewable electricity generation from 2000–2020 with line charts.
- Top Country Rankings: Compared the top 10 countries by renewable electricity generation in specific years using bar plots.
- Energy Mix: Examined the breakdown of renewable, fossil, and nuclear electricity for selected countries with pie charts.
- Emissions Impact: Analyzed the correlation between renewable electricity growth and CO2 emissions using scatterplots and trend lines.
- Distribution and Comparison: Assessed the spread and disparities in renewable capacity per capita via boxplots and histograms, and highlighted top and bottom countries by    year.
- Economic Relationship: Investigated GDP per capita versus renewable energy capacity per capita for individual years and over time.
- Global Patterns: Used heatmaps to show inter-correlations between all major variables.
- Forecasting: Applied time series modeling to predict future renewable electricity generation for individual countries.
- Additional Trends: Visualized global and country-specific CO2 emission trends in relation to renewable growth.
